      <p><strong>The Program<&#47;strong></p>
<p>The Management Associate (MA) Program is tailored to develop you as a high-potential individual for leadership roles in Citibank Vietnam. Upon entering the Program, you will not only acquire advanced banking knowledge, but also the leadership and interpersonal skills that enable you to maximize your potential early and to define your own career.</p>
<p>The Vietnam Management Associate Program is a 24 month program and is structured as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Year 1, 3 x 4 month rotations<br />
&bull; Year 2, 12 month assignment</p>
<p>In addition you will be given class room training, opportunities to interact with Senior Leaders, MA assignments, assigned buddies and mentors to support you throughout the program. By giving you exposure and insight into the different business areas, it will give you an opportunity not only to see how those areas work, but to develop your people and relationship skills in order to build a network of contacts &ndash; which will be very useful as you move through the organization.</p>
<p>At the end of the program, you will be assigned to one business. The assignment is based on a combination of your personal preferences and business needs. We appreciate that earlier in your career it is harder to pin point where you want to work. The structure of the program means that you will have the opportunity to explore different areas before making your final decision.</p>
<p>In Citibank Vietnam we have 3 Management Associate Program streams:</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Operations &amp; Technology (O&amp;T) MA Program<&#47;em><br />
o Rotations will comprise of 2 x O&amp;T rotations, 1 x business rotation, 12 month assignment in O&amp;T<br />
o At the end of the program you will lead a small unit within O&amp;T</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Consumer Bank MA Program<&#47;em><br />
o Rotations will comprise of 3 x rotations within Consumer, 12 month assignment in Consumer Bank<br />
o At the end of the program you will be assigned in a Consumer Bank business</p>
<p>The MA Program is demanding and your learning curve will be steep. However, you will not be bored and will constantly be faced with new challenges.</p>

Not to mention that we expect you to work well both independently and effectively in a team, while exhibiting the highest commitment to integrity and ethical decision making. Finally, you need to demonstrate leadership qualities and a passion to further develop your leadership potential.</p>
<p>We are seeking entrepreneurs who can think creatively to identify new business opportunities and execute innovative ideas successfully as well as those that exhibit flexibility, adaptability and resilience to face the demands of working in a challenging and fast paced environment.</p>
